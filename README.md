# SCBehavior Dataset

 SCBehavior Dataset is created for student behavior detection and analysis.

## Introduction
**SCBehavior-Dataset** comprises 1,346 high-resolution images of classroom scenes, each with varying distributions of student behaviors. We encompasses seven different types of student behaviors: read, write, lookup, raise_hand, turn_head, stand, and discuss. These categories essentially cover the typical behaviors observed in daily classroom activities. 
The diverse distribution of these behaviors across different scenes enhances the dataset’s robustness and applicability in real-world scenarios.

## Usage

We also provide the dataset in both **YOLO** and **COCO** formats for the convenience of other researchers.

## Examples
